                Perhaps the most elemental structural property of bacteria is their
                 morphology (shape). Typical examples include: 
                 <ol>
                <li>coccus (circle or spherical)</li>
                <li>bacillus (rod-like)</li>
                <li>coccobacillus (between a sphere and a rod)</li>
                <li>spiral (corkscrew-like)</li>
                <li>filamentous (elongated)</li>
                 </ol>
                Cell shape is generally characteristic of a given bacterial species,
                 but can vary depending on growth conditions. Some bacteria have complex life 
                 cycles involving the production of stalks and appendages (e.g. Caulobacter) 
                 and some produce elaborate structures bearing reproductive spores 
                 (e.g. Myxococcus, Streptomyces). Bacteria generally form distinctive cell
                  morphologies when examined by light microscopy and distinct colony morphologies 
                  when grown on Petri plates.
